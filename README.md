Created with sheer stubborness, Deepseek, Claude and Bolt.new using examples/social/shapes-revolt in main Shapes.Inc API repo
Supports replies to bot in channels and Revolt Masquerade. Shapes are chosen via !shaper command and corresponding emoji (like reaction roles)
Shape selection is user and channel-saved, meaning: user 1 speaks to shape 1, user 2 selects shape 2 ---> user 1 still speaks to shape 1
You need your own tokens and put them into .env: cp .env.example .env
Shape usernames and avatars: see config folder

Normal readme later maybe :) I'm out of AI tokens for now lol

Deployment: *clueless hedgehog sounds* VPS and node.js, something like that :3
